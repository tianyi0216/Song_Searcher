# Song_Searcher
Project developed during CS 400.

The song searcher textual app takes a xml file of song data and then provide functions on search by title, artists and also add songs into it. We also have functions to remove a song but it has not been tested thoroughly yet.

App is developed in Java. It is based on a Red Black Tree data structure. The app actually utilizes two red blakc tree to provide searching by two attributes so it executes efficiently.

I was the backend developer in this project and mainly wrote "SongSearcherBackend.java" and its associated files.

Skill utlizied: Red Black Tree, Lambda Expression, Junit test.

Collaborated with 3 others, Wendell Cai, Haozhe Wu and Bill Zhu.
